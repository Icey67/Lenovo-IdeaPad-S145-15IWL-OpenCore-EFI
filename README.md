# Lenovo-IdeaPad-S145-15IWL-OpenCore-EFI
This is an EFI built with OpCore-Simplify for my laptop to run macOS 13.7.4 (and now macOS 15.5)

# Disclaimer
### DO NOT USE THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT! Hackintoshes are known for instability and breaking over time, I cannot guarantee that this EFI works with your system flawlessly.

## PLEASE DON'T BLAME ANYBODY ON THE INTERNET FOR BRICKING YOUR DEVICE
It was your decision and responsibility what to do with your device, for example: 

downloading a random rom made for the creator's device and applying it to your own.

# What DOESN'T work?
Honestly no idea, it's running kind of well for me.

Sure there are some hitches, lags and delays for some things but otherwise I have no real clue.

# Note:
I noticed when trying to boot macOS with a second display connected via HDMI can cause it to black screen,

and when playing osu!lazer with the Metal Rendering API there are graphical issues with said second display.

It appears fine when using only one screen

# IMPORTANT!
If you plan to log into Apple ID with this EFI

PLEASE make sure you change the SMBIOS to something else, because we'll both be in trouble if you don't.
